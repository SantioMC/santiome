		Hello there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Santio, a backend and infrastructure developer from
		Canada. I'm primarily a backend developer but in recent years I've been working with tools such as Kubernetes, Terraform, and other CI/CD tools to help manage and scale infrastructure for some of my work (For example, <Ref name="Hideaway" image="/img/hideaway.png" link="#hideaway" />).
